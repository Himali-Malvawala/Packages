# @churchapps/apphelper

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- afebf7e: Canonical `FileUpload` component in apphelper and `FileInterface` in helpers, replacing the per-app copies that had drifted across B1Admin, B1App, B1Mobile, and LessonsApp.
- afebf7e: `@churchapps/helpers` is now a peerDependency instead of a regular dependency, so consuming apps resolve exactly one copy (ApiHelper config state is a singleton). Consumers that relied on the transitive copy must add `@churchapps/helpers` to their own dependencies.
